Added `numpy.char.slice_`
-------------------------
Allows slicing of strings within character arrays of type `np.str_` and
`np.unicode_`. In addition to the normal slice parameters of `start`,
`stop` and `step`, this function supports a `chunksize` parameter. Slices
with `step == chunksize == 1` are treated slightly differently than other
slices, in that they do not add an extra dimension to the array. This
oft-requested feature is conceptually simple, but ran afoul of the dtype
conversion checks in view creation until now.
